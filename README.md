### Twitter Classification Project
Social media has provided a platform for users to communicate, interact, express opinions, and share information throughout various communities. Within the vast amount of user-generated content, there are potential insights that can be found by analyzing this data. Using machine learning, researchers can learn valuable patterns and insights that can be used to help make decisions on tasks like:

* Sentiment analysis
* Social network analysis
* Recommending content and products
* Predicting trends
* Improving customer engagement

In this project, we’ll be working with real Twitter (now X) data to find patterns in the way people use social media. We have provided four datasets (with brief descriptions in the Setup pane above) that you will use to find insights using machine learning.

The purpose of this project is for you to explore a real dataset and come up with your own data question that can be solved using data science. You will go through each step of the data science process such as cleaning and preparing the data, analyzing features, training a machine learning model, and summarizing the insights you find. How you go about each step is entirely up to you!
